A repository that contains my approaches and solutions for Codewars challenges. I push at least 1 solution each day.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

After studying a programming related subject, I solve a Codewars challenge on that topic to train and reinforce what I've learned.

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my coding solutions for efficiency or readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in this process is about perseverance. There always be a solution for every problem, maybe the answer doesn’t come right away, so it’s important to keep studying to have more tools to tackle the challenges from new perspectives.
